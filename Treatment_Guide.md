# Follicular Lymphoma Treatment Guide

## Introduction
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for about 20-30% of all NHL cases. It is a B‑cell malignancy derived from germinal center B cells, characterized by a translocation t(14;18) leading to overexpression of the anti‑apoptotic protein BCL‑2. FL typically presents in older adults (median age 60‑65 years) with painless peripheral lymphadenopathy, often with bone marrow involvement. The disease course is indolent but incurable with standard therapies, with a median survival exceeding 10–15 years.

## Staging Systems
The Ann Arbor staging system is universally used to stage follicular lymphoma:
- **Stage I**: Involvement of a single lymph node region or a single extralymphatic site (IE).
- **Stage II**: Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.
- **Stage III**: Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm.
- **Stage IV**: Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs (e.g., bone marrow, liver, lung).

The Lugano classification, a modification of Ann Arbor, incorporates functional imaging (PET‑CT) and defines limited (stage I‑II) and advanced (stage III‑IV) disease.

## First‑Line Treatment for Advanced‑Stage (Stage III/IV) FL
For asymptomatic advanced‑stage FL, observation (“watch‑and‑wait”) remains a standard option. When treatment is indicated (due to symptoms, organ compromise, cytopenias, rapid progression, or patient preference), first‑line regimens typically combine anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibodies with chemotherapy or immunomodulatory agents.

### Common First‑Line Options
- **Rituximab**: A chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen on B cells. Mechanism: induces antibody‑dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement‑dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and direct apoptosis. Often combined with chemotherapy (R‑CHOP, R‑CVP, R‑bendamustine) or used as monotherapy.
- **Obinutuzumab**: A humanized, glycoengineered type II anti‑CD20 monoclonal antibody. Mechanism: enhanced ADCC and direct cell death, with reduced CDC compared to rituximab. It is often combined with chemotherapy (e.g., G‑CHOP, G‑bendamustine) and has shown superior progression‑free survival in some trials.
- **Bendamustine**: A bifunctional alkylating agent with both alkylating and purine analogue properties. Mechanism: forms DNA cross‑links leading to apoptosis, and also inhibits DNA repair pathways. Combined with rituximab (BR) it is a widely used, well‑tolerated regimen with high response rates and a favorable toxicity profile compared to R‑CHOP.
- **Lenalidomide**: An immunomodulatory derivative of thalidomide. Mechanism: enhances T‑cell and NK‑cell activity, inhibits angiogenesis, and promotes tumor cell apoptosis via cereblon‑mediated degradation of transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos. Often used with rituximab (R² regimen) as a chemotherapy‑free option.

### Other Considerations
- **Maintenance therapy**: After induction, rituximab maintenance (every 2‑3 months for up to 2 years) prolongs remission duration.
- **Radiolabeled antibodies** (e.g., 90Y‑ibritumomab tiuxetan) and **PI3K inhibitors** (e.g., idelalisib, copanlisib) are reserved for relapsed/refractory disease.

## Radiation Therapy
Radiation therapy (RT) plays a definitive role in the management of early‑stage (Stage I/II) follicular lymphoma. For patients with limited‑stage disease, involved‑site radiotherapy (ISRT) delivered to the affected lymph node region(s) can achieve long‑term disease control and is potentially curative.

- **Curative Potential**: In early‑stage FL, radiation alone yields 10‑year progression‑free survival rates of 40‑50% and overall survival rates >80%. A significant proportion of patients (≈30‑40%) remain disease‑free beyond 10 years, suggesting that RT may be curative in a subset.
- **Typical Dose**: The standard dose is 24–30 Gy delivered in 12–15 fractions over 2.5–3 weeks. Lower doses (e.g., 4 Gy in 2 fractions) are sometimes used for palliative intent in symptomatic bulky disease.
- **Technique**: Modern RT uses conformal techniques (3D‑CRT, IMRT, VMAT) to minimize exposure of adjacent normal tissues. The target volume includes the involved lymph node(s) with a margin, as defined by the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group (ILROG) guidelines.
- **Integration with Systemic Therapy**: For some patients with high‑risk features (e.g., bulky disease, elevated LDH), combined modality therapy (RT plus rituximab) may be considered, though evidence is limited.
- **Late Effects**: Potential long‑term toxicities include secondary malignancies (especially in younger patients), hypothyroidism (for neck irradiation), and cardiovascular effects (for mediastinal RT).
